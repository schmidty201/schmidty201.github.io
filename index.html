<h3>About this Blog</h3>
<p><img src="images/profilepic.jpg" title="Me and an exposed brick wall." width="150" height="150" alight="left">I've recently been interested in coding, so naturally I decided to learn HTML and CSS languages. I am currently teaching myself the basics, and becoming more familiar with how web development works. More importantly, I've found that I actually <b>enjoy</b> it.Having worked in a specific sector for so long, I realized I'd plateaued and likely wouldn't accelerate my career without an advanced degree, or a mastery in something more technical. Well, here I am. Let's see where it takes me!</P> 

<h3>A Few Things to Note:</h3>	
<ol>
	<li>Live...there's only one other choice with this one.</li>
		<li>Love...don't be a dick.</li>
			<li>Learn...there's always something you don't know, even when you think you know everything.</li>
				<li>Laugh...don't take yourself so seriously.</li>
