<h1>Building My Own Website and Other Things</h1>
    <h4>There's nothing more exciting than learning something new.</h4>
  <h3>About this Blog</h3>
<p>I've recently been interested in web development, so naturally I decided to learn HTML and CSS languages. I am currently teaching myself the basics, and becoming more familiar with how web development works. More importantly, I've found that I actually <i>enjoy</i> it. Having worked in a specific sector for so long, I realized I'd plateaued and likely wouldn't accelerate my career without an advanced degree, or a mastery in something more technical.</P>
<p><img src="images/profilepic.jpg" title="Me and an exposed brick wall." class="align-left small" />I'm excited to be learning something new. It can be very frustrating at times, but overall, I'm enjoying the learning experience. The best thing I've done so far is staying consistent with both books and online learning tools.</p>

<h3>A Few Things to Note:</h3>
