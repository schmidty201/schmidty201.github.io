  <h3>About this Blog</h3>
<img src="images/profilepic.jpg" title="Me and an exposed brick wall." width="200" height="200" class="align-left small" />
<p>I've recently been interested in web development, so naturally I decided to learn HTML and CSS languages. I am currently teaching myself the basics, and becoming more familiar with how web development works. More importantly, I've found that I actually <i>enjoy</i> it. Having worked in a specific sector for so long, I realized I'd plateaued and likely wouldn't accelerate my career without an advanced degree, or a mastery in something more technical.</P>
<p>I'm excited to be learning something new. It can be very frustrating at times, but overall, I'm enjoying the learning experience. The best thing I've done so far is staying consistent with both books and online learning tools.</p>

<h3>A Few Things to Note:</h3>
<p>I was born in update New York, but grew up in Northeast Ohio. I originally wanted to be a filmaker and writer, and after testing the waters in Los Angeles I quickly realized it wasn't for me. LA...the Hollywood scene...the entire industry seemed rigged, uneven, and filled with an overbearing falsehood. I moved to Washington, DC to get a degree in journalism and international relations. I fell in love with DC (albeit, not having realized the similarities between LA and DC). I eventually transfered out and graduated from Ohio State University and moved back to DC to pursue some sort of political career, or one in diplomacy. Six years later, I'm still here, loving the city, but hating the politics and desperately wanting something new. I don't do well with complacency</p>
